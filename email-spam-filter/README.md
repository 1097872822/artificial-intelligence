# Email Spam Filter





## Dataset

In this lab, we will use the Ô¨Årst 9 folds from the ling-spam corpus (lemm_stop folder, with both lemmatization and stop-word enabled) as training data, and the 10 fold as test data.

Download the whole ling-spam dataset from http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/lingspam_public.tar.gz 

Each one of the 10 subdirectories contains both spam and legitimate 
messages, one message in each file. Files whose names have the form
spmsg*.txt are spam messages. All other files are legitimate messages.
